= About

🧗‍♂️ Hi! My name is Maik. I'm a Software Engineer and a Chaos Monkey. I studied at https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/[HdM Stuttgart] where I graduated with a Bachelor degree in audiovisual media and a Master's degree in electronic media with a strong focus on visual effects and software development.

🏗 I work at https://www.codecentric.de/[codecentric AG] as an full time IT Consultant and Chaos Engineer.

🎙 I love giving talks and workshops about Chaos Engineering. 

👻 Oh and I stutter, so what could possibly go wrong?
