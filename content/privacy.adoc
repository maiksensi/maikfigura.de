== Personal Data

This blog does not collect any personal data. This blog collects anonymimized logfiles. The logfile contains the web browser agent and the operating system identifier. My hosting provider (uberspace.de) anonymimizes the IP addresses in the logs automatically. The data is only collected to be able to detect errors in case of disaster. Thus, I donâ€™t consider this personal data.
